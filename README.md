# WinFetch

WinFetch is a small **Windows-only CLI tool** inspired by FastFetch. It shows basic system information directly in the terminal in a clean and simple way.

This tool is made **only for Windows** and focuses on being lightweight and easy to understand.

Please forgive me because **my code** is trash.

## ✨ Features

* Shows Windows OS information
* Displays system details like CPU, memory, gpu and drive 
* Simple and clean terminal output
* No extra dependencies
* Made completely using **C++ and Windows API**

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I built WinFetch as a **learning project** to:

* Practice C++ on Windows
* Learn Windows system APIs
* Understand how CLI tools work
* Build something useful and fun
* It may face some bugs

This project is still improving, and I’m learning as I go 🚀
